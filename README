This is a kind of ultra-thin Linux distribution.  It serves two purposes:
  -- it's very quick and easy (1 command: mklinux) to generate a bootable
     CD-ROM image; it's also very fast to boot (5-10s)
  -- the contents of the file system is very easy to modify: just do the
     modification and regenerate the image

This whole work is intended to be used in VirtualBox, but may be usable
with other virtual machines.  Just generate the bootable CD-ROM image:
 $ ./mklinux base
fs.iso created

Then create a virtual machine which has an IDE CD-ROM drive and load fs.iso.
You don't have to create a hard disk.  This also means any changes made to
the file system are lost.

Networking: use the Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop (8254OEM) network device
(its driver is loaded automatically at startup).

USB: enable the appropriate device in the Devices menu and say `usbon'
in the VM.  After that you can `mount /mnt'.  Note that there has to be
a physical device in the USB port.

In kernel-3.15 everything is built-in; for some reason I disabled modules
support.  Most (all?) of other binaries are from my own Debian 6.0.6/7.4.

You're provided with 8 virtual terminals.  (You can switch between them
with Alt-F2, F3, ...)

There are a couple of 'add-ons' which can extend the functionality of
the base system.  These are:
  -- more: some common libraries and useful binaries (less and strace);
     the other add-ons depend on these libraries.  It also contains gpm(1);
     to use it you need to DISABLE "absolute pointing device" in the
     System/Motherboard tab in your VM's settings.
  -- iproute: ip(1) and friends
  -- iptables: depends on the `more' add-on
  -- ssh: start sshd by simply saying `sshd' on the command line,
     then you can `ssh localhost' without trouble; also includes sftp
  -- libc-2.17: these libraries co-exist with the base system's libc 2.13

You can add an add-on with `mklinux <your-file-system> [<add-on>]',
for example:
 $ mklinux fs more ssh
installs the `more' and `ssh' add-ons.  (Actually it just hardlinks files.)
You should run ldconfig then because of the new libraries:
 $ ./mklinux -li
